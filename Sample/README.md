# Running the code with MinGW

Go where you install **MinGW** and search the bat file called *open_distro_window* and double click it that will open a command prompt. Next go to your path where you have your `cpp` files and run inside the command prompt this command:

```sh
C:\path-of-your-code>g++ youCode.cpp
```

That command will compile your code and create the executable.
